This is a starter application wrapper for a Time-of-Flight demo.

Hardware assumption:
- FRDM-MCXN947
- LCD-PAR-S035 (FlexIO 8080 path)
- TMF8828_EVM_EB_SHIELD on host I2C path

Code lives in this repo:
- `src/`
- `docs/`

This example's CMake pulls sources from this repo so development stays in one place.
